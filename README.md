# üöÄ Microsoft x Rise DC x Hack4Impact-UMD
Welcome to the Microsoft x Rise DC x Hack4Impact-UMD Hackathon! üéâ We're so excited to have all of us work on such a meaningful and impactful project, and can't wait to see what we all build together!

Throughout the course of this week, you will be working on a specific subproject alongside your assigned team. To make sure we avoid code conflicts and are able to organize all the features easily for Rise DC, you will notice that we have folders for each. Please do all work for your respective feature within the folder!

Also, as the week progresses, this readme will be updated with any new information that participants should know and understand, so please keep an eye on the readme at least once a day!
The project descriptions for each feature are provided below, along with their associated folders.

Good luck to you all, and have fun! This is going to be an amazing week. ‚ú®

## ‚ù§Ô∏è About Rise DC

[Rise DC](https://www.risewithusdc.com/) provides daily therapeutic support and life skills training for young adults ages 18-30 with moderate to severe intellectual disabilities. They focus on building functional life skills such as hygiene, cooking, job readiness, and independent commuting through structured support, including a young adult day program and social groups.

## üõ†Ô∏è Projects

### üßë‚Äçüç≥ Adaptive Digital Cookbook
Problem

> Young adults struggle to follow traditional recipes due to cognitive and literacy challenges. Physical cookbooks are not engaging or accessible enough. Rise DC has a physical adaptive cookbook with 15 printed adaptive recipes, and would like to help translate this into a digital solution.

Desired Solution

> A digital adaptive cookbook that uses simple visuals and step-by-step instructions to make recipes easier to follow. Features would include multimedia guides (images, gifs, or short videos showing actions like ‚Äúspread peanut butter‚Äù), basic appliance tutorials (using the microwave or oven), and the ability for participants or supports to add and save custom recipes. The cookbook would also include meal prep planning (assigning recipes to specific meals and days of the week), along with a ‚Äúcart‚Äù system to generate grocery lists according to the user's budget.

### üìÜ Visual Scheduling & Daily Routines

Problem

 > Young adults struggle with transitioning between activities and remembering multistep tasks. Most have a reading/math level at or below first grade, so written instructions are often inaccessible. Staff currently assist directly but want a tool to foster greater independence.

Desired Solution

> A scheduling interface offering customizable daily and task-based schedules with simple words and visuals for ease of use at home or at Rise DC. It will include features such as voice prompts, alarms, detailed checklists, accountability methods, visual supports, and both participant and support interfaces to promote independence, reduce staff reliance, and allow seamless collaboration between participants, families, and staff

### üèÜ Goal Tracking & ISP Management Platform

Problem

> Rise DC staff must meet DDS documentation requirements (annual ISPs, quarterly progress notes, daily notes, participant paperwork, and staff training logs), but the current system is fragmented across Google Forms, PDFFiller, and manual tracking. This creates challenges with ensuring notes are completed daily, reducing repetitive or incomplete data, reassigning tasks when staff are absent, preparing for audits, simplifying parent paperwork, and tracking training for staff. The process is time-consuming, confusing, and prone to errors.

Desired Solution

> A CRM platform that streamlines all DDS-required documentation and communication in one place. Each participant will have a profile with emergency information, schedules, and documentation tabs, while staff will have daily task checklists, automated reminders for missing notes, and the ability to upload photos or generate varied progress note text. The system will track ISP and quarterly deadlines with integrated calendars, compile data into trends, and provide a user-friendly portal for parents to complete required paperwork. It will also feature a dedicated training log tab for each participant, staff and parent communication tools, and printable versions of documents.
