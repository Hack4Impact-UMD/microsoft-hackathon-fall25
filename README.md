# üöÄ Microsoft x RISE DC x Hack4Impact-UMD
Welcome to the Microsoft x Rise DC x Hack4Impact-UMD Hackathon! üéâ We're so excited to have all of us work on such a meaningful and impactful project, and can't wait to see what we all build together!

This is a single React application with two main features for RISE DC. All teams will work together in the same codebase to build an integrated solution.

Good luck to you all, and have fun! This is going to be an amazing week. ‚ú®

## üöÄ Getting Started

```bash
cd rise-dc-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app includes a basic temporary navbar to navigate between the two main features.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è About RISE DC

[Rise DC](https://www.risewithusdc.com/) provides daily therapeutic support and life skills training for young adults ages 18-30 with moderate to severe intellectual disabilities. They focus on building functional life skills such as hygiene, cooking, job readiness, and independent commuting through structured support, including a young adult day program and social groups.

## üõ†Ô∏è Projects

### üßë‚Äçüç≥ Adaptive Digital Cookbook
Problem

> Young adults struggle to follow traditional recipes due to cognitive and literacy challenges. Physical cookbooks are not engaging or accessible enough. Rise DC has a physical adaptive cookbook with 15 printed adaptive recipes, and would like to help translate this into a digital solution.

Desired Solution

> A digital adaptive cookbook that uses simple visuals and step-by-step instructions to make recipes easier to follow. Features would include multimedia guides (images, gifs, or short videos showing actions like ‚Äúspread peanut butter‚Äù), basic appliance tutorials (using the microwave or oven), and the ability for participants or supports to add and save custom recipes. The cookbook would also include meal prep planning (assigning recipes to specific meals and days of the week), along with a ‚Äúcart‚Äù system to generate grocery lists according to the user's budget.

### üìÜ Visual Scheduling & Daily Routines

Problem

 > Young adults struggle with transitioning between activities and remembering multistep tasks. Most have a reading/math level at or below first grade, so written instructions are often inaccessible. Staff currently assist directly but want a tool to foster greater independence.

Desired Solution

> A scheduling interface offering customizable daily and task-based schedules with simple words and visuals for ease of use at home or at Rise DC. It will include features such as voice prompts, alarms, detailed checklists, accountability methods, visual supports, and both participant and support interfaces to promote independence, reduce staff reliance, and allow seamless collaboration between participants, families, and staff
